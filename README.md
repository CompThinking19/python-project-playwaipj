# ThoughtBot

## Thanksgiving Edition.

- This project will be using randomization to generate thoughts. Most of the generated thoughts may not make sense, but that's not different from how thoughts work in reality.

- Currently the random thoughts are generated using datasets stored using json files with adjectives from `adjectives.json` and animals from `animals.json` found on the internet, I will try to switch some things up to make the thoughts more interesting and realistic.

- I've also added some TODO tasks using the `todo.json` file.

- Using quotes found online. Stored in `quotes.json`.

- I might be able to make a website for this project. I'll need to learn some javascript for that first.

- Added ASCII art for thanksgiving.

### TODO

- Add more entries to the `todo.json` file.

- Sometimes the random thoughts will be same as the previous thought. Find a way to change that.

### Note

- This project uses f-Strings which is a part of Python 3.6 and above. Please use the appropriate version to run the `tb.py` file. The command `python3.6 tb.py` works well on clamshell.

- The screen width should be atleast `42` ( [Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_%28number%29#The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy) ) characters wide to display the starting text successfully.
